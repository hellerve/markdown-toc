# markdown toc

A small zepto-based TOC generator for Markdown files.
This README's TOC was generated with it.

##Table Of Contents
  * [markdown toc](#markdown-toc)
    * [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)
    * [Usage](#usage)
    * [Why?](#why)
    * [Caveats](#caveats)

## Usage

```
zepto main.zp README.md
```

## Why?

Because I wanted to. There is no reasonable explanation,
it is neither faster, easier to use or more reliable than
other tools.

It is ~20 lines long, though, which is quite cool.

## Caveats

It only parses pound-sign based headings, because I mostly use
those. It could be easily generalized, I guess, but I did not
need to yet.

Have fun!
